Unreal pluging adding voice transcription (speech to text) using Mozilla https://github.com/mozilla/DeepSpeech.


## Code quality
- This plugin serves as a proof of concept that was quickly cobbled together.
- Code quality isn't great, it's readable. Global variables are used! I don't plan on actively maintaining this plugin, but PRs are welcome.
